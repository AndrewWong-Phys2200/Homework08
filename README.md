With an initial altitude of 2 and a launch angle of 0, the horizontal distance drops off at about 27
with initial velocity > 2


## Horizontal Distance vs Launch angle

With an initial launch angle of 0 and initial velocity of 2, the horizontal distance seems to increase
linearly with increasing initial velocity
